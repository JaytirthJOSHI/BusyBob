# Music Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up music integration for BusyBob, enabling Spotify connectivity for focus playlists and mood-based music recommendations.

## Features

- **Spotify Integration**: Connect your Spotify account for personalized music experiences
- **Mood-Based Playlists**: Get playlist recommendations based on your current mood (1-5 scale)
- **Focus Sessions**: Start timed focus sessions with adaptive music
- **Music Analytics**: Track your listening patterns and their correlation with productivity
- **Playback Controls**: Control Spotify playback directly from BusyBob

## Spotify API Setup

### 1. Create a Spotify App

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create an App"
4. Fill in the app details:
   - **App Name**: BusyBob Music Integration
   - **App Description**: Student productivity platform with mood-based music recommendations
   - **Website**: Your BusyBob domain (e.g., https://busybob.site)
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/spotify/callback`
5. Agree to the terms and create the app

### 2. Configure App Settings

1. In your app dashboard, click "Settings"
2. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Under "Redirect URIs", add:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/spotify/callback` (for development)
   - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/spotify/callback` (for production)
4. Save the settings

### 3. Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Spotify API Configuration
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

## Database Setup

Run the music integration migration to set up the required database tables:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or apply the migration manually in your Supabase dashboard
# Upload the file: supabase/migrations/20241219000000_add_music_integration.sql
```

This creates the following tables:
- `music_connections` - Store Spotify OAuth tokens
- `listening_history` - Track user's listening habits
- `music_analytics` - Store mood-music correlations
- `focus_playlists` - User's saved focus playlists
- `music_mood_correlations` - Analytics for mood-based recommendations

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

- `Music.js` - Main music integration component
- Mood-based playlist selection
- Focus session management
- Playback controls and current track display
- Music analytics visualization

### Backend Endpoints

- `GET /auth/spotify/callback` - OAuth callback handling
- `GET /api/spotify/recommendations` - Get mood-based recommendations
- `GET /api/spotify/me` - User profile information
- `GET /api/spotify/player` - Current playback state
- `PUT /api/spotify/player/play` - Start playback
- `PUT /api/spotify/player/pause` - Pause playback
- `POST /api/spotify/player/next` - Skip to next track
- `POST /api/spotify/player/previous` - Skip to previous track

### Database Schema

The integration uses several tables to store:
- OAuth tokens and connection status
- Listening history and session data
- Music analytics and mood correlations
- User's focus playlists and preferences

## Security Considerations

### Token Management

- Access tokens are stored securely in the database
- Tokens are automatically refreshed when expired
- Session-based authentication for API calls

### Data Privacy

- Only necessary Spotify data is stored
- User can disconnect and delete all music data
- Full compliance with data protection regulations

### API Rate Limits

- Respectful API usage with appropriate rate limiting
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Graceful handling of API errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to connect to Spotify"**
   - Check your Spotify Client ID and Secret
   - Verify redirect URIs are correctly configured
   - Ensure your app is not in "Development Mode" restrictions

2. **"No music playing" despite connection**
   - Make sure Spotify is open on at least one device
   - Check that BusyBob has playback permissions
   - Try refreshing the connection

3. **Recommendations not loading**
   - Verify the Spotify Web API is accessible
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure proper genre seeds are being sent

4. **Focus sessions not starting**
   - Check timer implementation in browser
   - Verify session tracking in database
   - Ensure proper mood data correlation

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding this to your browser console:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('musicDebug', 'true')
```

This will provide detailed logging for:
- API requests and responses
- Token refresh cycles
- Mood-playlist correlations
- Focus session analytics
