## üìè Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style

- **ES6+ features:** Use modern JavaScript
- **Async/await:** Prefer over promises for readability
- **Error handling:** Always handle errors gracefully
- **Comments:** Document complex educational logic
- **Variable naming:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `studentGrades` not `data`)

### Privacy-First Development

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Minimal data collection
const gradeData = {
  courseId: assignment.courseId,
  grade: assignment.grade,
  dueDate: assignment.dueDate
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Collecting unnecessary data
const studentData = {
  fullName: student.name,
  ssn: student.ssn,
  address: student.address,
  grade: assignment.grade
}
```

### Educational Context

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Consider educational workflows
async function syncAssignments() {
  try {
    const assignments = await fetchStudentVueAssignments()
    // Always validate assignment data for student safety
    const validatedAssignments = validateEducationalData(assignments)
    return validatedAssignments
  } catch (error) {
    // Provide helpful error messages for students
    throw new EducationalSyncError('Unable to sync assignments. Please check your StudentVue credentials.')
  }
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Educational Data Protection

1. **Minimize data collection:** Only collect necessary educational data
2. **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive student information
3. **Access controls:** Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Audit trails:** Log access to educational data
5. **Data retention:** Follow educational data retention policies

### Code Security

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Secure API calls
async function fetchStudentData(studentId, credentials) {
  // Validate inputs
  if (!validateStudentId(studentId)) {
    throw new SecurityError('Invalid student ID')
  }

  // Use secure authentication
  const authenticatedClient = await createSecureClient(credentials)
  return await authenticatedClient.getStudentData(studentId)
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Insecure implementation
async function fetchStudentData(studentId) {
  // Direct API call without validation
  return fetch(`/api/student/${studentId}`)
}
```

### Sensitive Information

- **Never commit credentials** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Sanitize user inputs** to prevent XSS/injection
- **Validate educational data** for accuracy and safety
- **Rate limit API calls** to prevent abuse

## üéì Educational Data Privacy

### FERPA Compliance

- **Educational records:** Follow FERPA guidelines for student record protection
- **Directory information:** Be cautious with student directory information
- **Parental consent:** Ensure proper consent for students under 18
- **Data sharing:** Limit data sharing to educational purposes only

### COPPA Compliance

- **Age verification:** Implement proper age verification for users under 13
- **Parental consent:** Obtain verifiable parental consent when required
- **Limited data collection:** Collect minimal data from children
- **No behavioral advertising:** Don't use children's data for advertising

### Best Practices

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Privacy-conscious data handling
class StudentDataHandler {
  constructor() {
    this.encryptionKey = process.env.STUDENT_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY
  }

  async storeGrades(studentId, grades) {
    // Encrypt sensitive educational data
    const encryptedGrades = await this.encrypt(grades)

    // Store with appropriate access controls
    return await this.database.storeWithAccessControls(
      studentId,
      encryptedGrades,
      { educationalUseOnly: true }
    )
  }
}
```
