## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agentic Thinking Process
1. **Analyze** the user's request and current context
2. **Identify** the root problem or goal
3. **Create** a multi-step plan if needed
4. **Suggest** specific actions with clear reasoning
5. **Anticipate** potential issues and prepare alternatives

### Local AI Integration
- Uses Ollama for local AI processing (privacy-focused)
- Fallback system for reliability
- Supports multiple AI models (default: Llama 3.2)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Local AI (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup-ai.sh

# Check status
./check-ai-status.sh
```

### 2. Features Available Immediately
- **Proactive Analysis**: Runs automatically after initialization
- **Enhanced Conversations**: More intelligent and contextual responses
- **Multi-Action Planning**: Comprehensive solutions to complex problems
- **Pattern Insights**: Automatic analysis of user behavior

### 3. Example Interactions

#### Academic Planning
```
User: "I have a math exam next week and I'm struggling"

AI Response:
🔍 Analysis: You have a math exam in 7 days. Based on your task completion rate of 85%, I recommend a structured approach.

📋 Plan:
1. Daily study sessions (90 minutes each)
2. Practice problems focus
3. Review sessions before exam

🎯 Actions:
[ACTION:CREATE_STUDY_PLAN:Mathematics:Next Friday]
[ACTION:ANALYZE_PATTERNS:tasks]
[ACTION:SCHEDULE_REMINDER:Math exam preparation:2 days]
```

#### Productivity Optimization
```
User: "I feel like I'm not being productive lately"

AI Response:
🔍 Analysis: Your recent task completion rate is 60%, down from your usual 85%. Your mood entries show average 2.8/5 this week.

💡 Insights:
• Lower mood correlates with decreased productivity
• You complete more tasks in the morning hours
• Breaking large tasks into smaller ones increases completion rate

🎯 Recommendations:
[ACTION:ANALYZE_PATTERNS:productivity]
[ACTION:CREATE_TASK:Schedule morning focus blocks]
[ACTION:CREATE_MOOD:3:Checking in on current mood]
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### AI Model Options
The system supports multiple AI models through Ollama:

```bash
# Install additional models
ollama pull codellama        # For code-related tasks
ollama pull mistral          # Alternative general model
ollama pull neural-chat      # Conversation-focused model
```

### Customizing Behavior
The AI can be configured through the system message to:
- Focus on specific subjects or goals
- Adjust planning complexity
- Change proactive analysis frequency
- Customize action suggestions

### Integration with BusyBob Features
- **Tasks**: Creates, analyzes, and optimizes task management
- **Mood Tracking**: Correlates mood with productivity patterns
- **Journal Entries**: Uses insights for personalized suggestions
- **Academic Services**: Integrates with Canvas and StudentVue data
- **Music**: Suggests mood-appropriate playlists for focus

## 📊 Data Privacy & Security

### Local Processing
- AI processing happens locally with Ollama
- No data sent to external servers for AI inference
- User data remains on device

### Data Storage
- Analysis results stored in local Supabase database
- Conversation history encrypted
- Pattern insights linked to user account

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Not Responding
1. Check if Ollama is running: `./check-ai-status.sh`
2. Restart Ollama: `ollama serve`
3. Verify model is installed: `ollama list`

#### Slow Responses
1. Ensure sufficient system resources
2. Consider using a smaller model
3. Check network connectivity for fallback services

#### Missing Features
1. Verify all dependencies are installed
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure user is authenticated

## 🔄 Updates & Maintenance

### Keeping Models Updated
```bash
# Update Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Update models
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Use `check-ai-status.sh` for health checks
- Monitor browser console for AI errors
- Check Supabase logs for data issues

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
